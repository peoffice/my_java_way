  * Simple to develop - IDEs and other developer tools are focused on building a single application
  * Easy to make radical changes to the application - You can change the code and the database achema, build, and deploy
  * Straightforward to test - The developers wrote end-to-end tests that launched the application, invoked the REST API, and tested the UI with Selenium.
  * Straightforward to deploy - All a developer had to do was copy the WAR file to a server that had Tomcat installed.
